# Zooming in the Hero image
## No any framework or library have been used to build this web page


### 1.how Zooming in works
___ 
There is a background image inside a banner section/hero section of the web page, when the page load , it is at it's original scale, when the page scrolled down, the background image is going to zoom in. <br>
To get this done, the stretegy I have used in this project is changing the background-size property value in the script file whenever the scroll event fiers

<br>
<br>

### 2.navbar underline effect on hover
___

This is not a regular nav link underline, the cursor moves on the navigation link except the first nav link, the dash which is beneath of the first nav link is going to move gradually to the whichever the cursor is currenlty on.
<br>
To achive this , I have used css positioning property and translate X property.
